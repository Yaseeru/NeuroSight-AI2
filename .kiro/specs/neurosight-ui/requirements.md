# Requirements Document

## Introduction

NeuroSight AI is a web-based frontend application that provides an accessible interface for AI-powered Alzheimer's disease screening from MRI scans. The system enables users to upload MRI images, receive AI-generated classification results across 4 stages of Alzheimer's, and connect with caregiver support communities. The UI prioritizes accessibility for elderly users and maintains a clean, medical-grade aesthetic with calming colors.

## Glossary

- **MRI Scan**: Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan of the brain, uploaded as JPG, PNG, or TIFF file
- **Classification**: AI-generated prediction of Alzheimer's stage (Non-Demented, Very Mild Dementia, Mild Dementia, Moderate Dementia)
- **Confidence Score**: Probability percentage indicating the AI model's certainty in its prediction
- **Diagnostic Dashboard**: The main interface where users upload MRI scans and view results
- **Support Widget**: UI component that appears after results, linking users to community resources
- **CTA**: Call-to-Action button prompting user interaction
